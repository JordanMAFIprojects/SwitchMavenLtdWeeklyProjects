 <h1>PART 2: Suicidal Old Guy </h1>
 <div id='main'>   
	That evening the poor old guy went to a nearby tall bridge and thought of what the technician told him. He looked down and saw the huge
fast flowing river and without hesitation, he jumped. The old guy died on the spot while in the air without hitting the river first because 
he was shocked that he actually jumped and got heart attack while still in mid air. 
THE END.
